This repository contains 2 csv files and the code to run them, this README file, and a written report with an analysis on the data.
Most of the code was based on the activities we performed during week 4 of the Data Analytics Bootcamp. In addition, I reviewed some functions details in Copilot. It is important to highlight that, to remove the '$' and conver the values in that column from objects to floats, 
I found an applicable code in Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32464280/how-to-convert-currency-column-with-and-to-numbers) from a person that had a similar issue that I encountered.
I also decided to change part of the proposed code for calculating the number of students per school that passed both math and reading with scores of 70 or higher, given that the way I had calculated the number of students that passed math and reading independently was applicable
to this task and I found easier to repeat the functions and only changing the variables.
Finally, I also received some warning messages that I couldn't remove, but since the code runs correclty, I decided not to change it.
